The folder contains images and many html pages which are interlinked to each other. 
The whole web pages are templates made using HTML, CSS ,Bootstrap and javascript.
In case you want to run this website on your desktop, you need to download the files on desktop
and update links to images as well as other webpages.

Here - index.html is the main page which is to be used first.
The login and sing up page are used as a modal popup on the combined.html.
Then comes the StartPage.html. 

The images are used on home page which is index.html here. These webpages are just a template made for demonstrating different features which can be a part of web designing at a larger level.
